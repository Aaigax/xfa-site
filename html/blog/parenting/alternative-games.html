          <h1>Alternatives To Video Games</h1>
          <p>Most children love video games, and the fascination with electronic entertainments such as game consoles,
            cell phones, and handheld devices is all part of our culture’s influence on technology. We believe that
            video games can teach certain skills or be educational to many children, but children spend too many hours
            with a controller in their hand primarily for pure entertainment, not educational. This will of course
            become an obsession that slowly starts to replace other activities and tear their life and their families
            apart.<br><br>

            Video games have been linked to a list of problems but there is a lot you can do to prevent this from
            occuring. In balance, “Limit Are The Keys” and then decide on your approach. Reassure them first and discuss
            alternatives activities to video games that will nourish your child’s developing mind to be even healthier
            as a result.

          <h2>8 Useful Alternative Activities To Video Games</h2>

          <ol>

            <li>Keep computers and consoles out of a child's bedroom.<p>As far as possible keep the console and computer
                visiable at all times. This is perhaps the very first step parents should take to monitor online
                activity if computers and consoles are in open spaces.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Assign video game time limit<p>Kids need
                limits and boundaries to know what is normal and healthy for them. Limiting the amount of time
                that your
                children spend sitting in front of a television, playing video games and surfing the Internet is
                important, especially in today's world of technology. Request the child to help and cooperate
                with you
                in
                this matter.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Show the child that you care<p>Start the
                discussion by telling your child that you love him/her and that you are concerned about her/his
                happiness
                and well-being. Discuss the harms of addictive video gaming. Tell them specifically about the
                dangers it
                causes as fatigue, laziness, poor grades at school, lack of self-esteem etc. Discuss alternative
                activities to video games.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Consistency is a critical element for
              effective parenting<p>Parental words and promises must always match parental actions. If you set a
                daily
                limit, it must be enforced. If you let your child get away with breaking rules without
                consequences, they
                will not take you seriously. Make sure to stick to your word if your child breaks the rules.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Read, Read, And Read More<p>Get your kids
                excited about reading, and you've earned about six gold stars. Stories in books can have an
                advantage
                because they get use to their own imagination which provides more satisfying and rich narrative
                than a
                lot
                of games do. Importantly, reading for pleasure helps kids develop academically.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Encourage your child to find other
              activities<p>Video games are only one way that children can entertain themselves. There are a lot
                of
                things
                they can do instead. Encourage your child to pursue other interests, and if they can't think of
                anything,
                suggest a few for them. Learn to play a musical instrument, learn a new language or take on some
                other
                big
                challenge. Of course, as a parent your participation is required to help finance the project and
                help
                see
                it to completion.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Go outdoors to appreciate nature<p>Get
                out of your house and get out of the concrete jungle to take time to appreciate the natural
                world. The
                best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside. I firmly believe that
                nature
                brings solace in all trouble and you'll also feel refreshed.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Encourage active hobbies<p>Encourage
                active hobbies instead. These can range from team sports, to bike riding, hiking - anything that
                gets
                your
                child outside and moving.This can also foster a love of exercise, something that will be a
                valuable
                interest to have throughout their lives.</p>
            </li>

          </ol>

          <p>
            It’s okay to have mindless fun once in a while, video games can be a fun way to escape. But a teen
            who spends much of their free time in front of a computer or video game console is missing out on the
            countless opportunities waiting just outside the front door. Like anything else, too much of something can
            be too much. Make sure that you don’t rely on video games for babysitting or because “there’s nothing
            to do”. It is easy to get into the habit without realising it but should invest much of their precious time
            into things that bring value to their lives.
