          <h1>Parenting</h1>
          <p>
            Being a parent is extremely rewarding and enjoyable but it is not always easy. As a parent you give your
            children a good start in life you nurture, protect and guide them. Providing a predictable home enviroment
            helps children to feel secure and promote a feeling of safety in stressful situations and relief from the
            changes they’re experiencing.<br><br>

            There are many things you can do to help your child grow and develop into a happy parents-happy kids
            environment. It’s about building relationships, communicating well and encouraging the kind of behaviour you
            want to see. A child’s brain is wired to naturally think, question, and explore; it is our responsibility,
            as a parent, to facilitate this yearning to learn and figure the world out around them. “Happy Parenting
            Happy Kids!”
