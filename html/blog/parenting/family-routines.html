          <h1>Family Routines</h1>
          <p>Setting up a Family Routine
            may help your family use time more effectively. Your child will be reassured by the routine’s structure and
            caters for the needs of all family members. All families benefit from routines and rituals, although this
            will look different in every family.

          <ul>

            <li>Consistent routine can be a way of teaching younger
              children healthy habits, like brushing their teeth, getting some exercise and to get enough sleep.</li>

            <li>An organised and predictable home enviroment helps
              children to feel safe and secure. It can help promote a feeling of safety in stressful situations and
              relief from the changes they’re experiencing.</li>

            <li>When children are involved in a good routine not only
              do they feel confident and in control, they also learn to develop positive social skills as well as a
              sense of satisfaction in being able to do things for themselves.</li>

            <li>Routines strengthen family bonds. Regular trips to
              the park, playground or even the grocery store can establish the necessary rhythm that makes your unique
              family tick.</li>

            <li>Home routines is the easiest place to learn long-term
              behaviours, and to understand the concepts of consequences, boundaries and rewards.</li>

          <h2>Useful Tips For Setting Up New Routines</h2>

          <p>There are no rules about how many or what kind of routines you
            should have. All families are different, and what works well for one family might not work for another.
            Your
            routines need to be based on your individual family needs. But effective routines do share three key
            features:
          </p>

          <ol>

            <li>Start small and be consistent<p>I can't stress this
                point enough. Just pick one simple routine you want to work on and don't tackle any others until this
                one
                is going smoothly. A good starting point might be clearing your plate from the dinner table, scrapping
                the
                leftovers into the compost, rinsing your plate in the sink and placing it in the dishwasher. Don't
                tackle
                your biggest issues first.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Take time for training<p>Don't assume your kids know
                how to do everything — sometimes, they must be taught. Scraping a plate takes some dexterity. Knowing
                the
                best way to load a dishwasher takes experience. Help them practice and learn what is expected. Your
                mindset should be that of a patient teacher instead of cursing them for being sloppy and doing things
                wrong.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Invite children to participate in routine-setting<p>
                Children are more likely to be co-operative if they feel they had some say in the rules and routines
                they are expected to live by. Of course this is an age-dependent factor, but live by the rule that the
                more say they have, the more co-operation you'll likely get.
              </P>
            </li>

          </ol>

          <p> There is no right or wrong way, only that
            you
            decide together and are consistent in living by the routines you’ve chosen together. Our children once
            requested a change to the family routine. They wanted to have private reading or music time before
            bedtime. So, we adjusted our timing accordingly so lights out was still at the same time. Routines can
            be
            great, but they shouldn’t be crutches. Don’t let your routines rule you, but use them to reinforce to
            your
            spouse and your kids that you love them, you value them, and you want to serve their needs, too.

          <h2>What To Do If You Aren't Getting Anywhere?</h2>
          <p>If you’re thinking to yourself, “I’ve been there, done that but with no success,” then here are five key
            questions to ask yourself:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Have I been totally consistent?</li>
            <li>Have I been persistent? Don’t give up too soon!</li>
            <li>Am I in a power struggle? Kids won’t comply to routines if
              they perceive you as being controlling.</li>
            <li>Have I made too many routines? If your house feels like a
              military regime, your children may rebel quietly or overtly</li>
            <li>Who can I turn to for help?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>There is always more to learn about raising kids. Don’t get
            overwhelmed, just recognize that it’s one of the best investments of your time. If you need more help with
            your parenting I recommend you move in ascending order from the most generic to the most expensive, but
            also the most in-depth. Ask your pediatrician for recommendations or other resources in your neighborhood.
