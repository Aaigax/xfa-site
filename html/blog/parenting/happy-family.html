          <h2>10 Useful Tips To What Makes A Happy Family</h2>

          <ol>

            <li>Create a mission statement
              <p>It may seem a little
                too business-like, but it works. A family mission statement can remind every family member about core
                values of what you love most about each other. Place your mission statement in a predominant place in
                your home. Read it and talk about it more often.</p>
            </li>

            <li> The power of prayer<p>The power of prayer in a
                family is the very foundation that keeps a family unit together. “A family that prays together stays
                together”. This concept is so true, the Almighty has it's foundation that may be shaken at times, but it
                will withstand all that comes against them.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Eat meals together<p>Studies have shown that
                eating meals together helps reinforce communication. Choose a few nights during the week when you
                expect
                everyone to gather around the dinner table. Don't allow phones or other electronics either. Just eat a
                meal and have a conversation together.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Schedule family time<p>Take a look at everyone’s
                schedule. Try to make a regular night, maybe once a week, when the entire family gets together for a
                fun
                activity. Keeping it on a regular schedule, everyone will know that they need to keep that night clear
                for
                family times.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Get involve in your children's interests<p>When your
                family is working as a team, everyone feels supported and able to contribute. It helps to have clear
                expectations, limits and boundaries. Ask where you can help, it will show your children you care about
                what they are interested in.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Encourage support<p>Family support is important and
                you can build this bond that will last your kids a lifetime, even when they're your age and after
                you're
                gone. Encourage everyone to learn about things that are important to everyone else and to support each
                other through good and bad times.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Have family meetings<p>Family meetings are a good time
                for everyone to check in with each other, grievances, or discuss future plans. These can be scheduled
                events or you can make them impromptu and allow any member of the family to call a meeting if they
                feel
                the need.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Do chores as a family<p>Make cleaning your home or
                caring for the yard a responsibility for the whole family. Create a list of chores and have everyone
                involved. Set up a time when everyone can tackle their chores at the same time. Give them a set time
                to
                have their chores completed.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Fight faster<p>The most important things said in an
                argument are usually said in the first 3 minutes. The aim of any argument with your partner should be
                about reaching a resolution. From there, it's just a bunch of rephrasing, but louder. At the end don't
                forget to say sorry!</p>
            </li>

            <li>Volunteer<p>Giving your time to make someone else’s
                life better is always a powerful learning experience. Learning important life lessons together will
                strengthen the relationship you have with your children. This will demonstrate a positive experience
                upon your children to acknowledge.</p>
