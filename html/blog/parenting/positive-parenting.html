          <h1>Positive Parenting</h1>
          <p>Kids are like a living copying
            machine. Whatever they see us doing and so forth he/she will to a large degree copy it. It’s logical, it’s
            what children do. And kids who grow up with positive parenting do well at school. They make friends easily.
            They feel good about themselves. They’re also less likely to have behavioural or emotional problems when
            they get older.

          <h2>6 Useful Tips For Positive Parenting</h2>

          <ol>

            <li>Create a Safe, Interesting Enviroment<p>Bored kids are
                likely to misbehave or may find trouble. So create an enviroment that allows kids to explore safely and
                develop their skills.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Have a Positive Learning Enviroment<p>If kids comes to
                you for help or a chat, they're ready to learn. Give them positive attention, even if only for a minute
                or
                so. Encourage their ideas and opinions.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Giving Your Child the Power of Positive Attitude!<p>
                Our kids are often very sensitive and susceptible to our own mental state. They're like clean slates -
                they just 'suck in' whatever mood you give them. And the younger they are, the more they just readily
                take
                in what you give them.<br><br>

                So being conscious of your own mood and behavior and making a choice as to what you want to transmit to
                your kid is one of the first steps in conscious and positive parenting.</p>

            <li>Have Realistic Expectation<p>
                Nobody's perfect - kids, teenages or adults - so don't expect your child to do more (or less) than
                they're
                capable of. And remember, we all make mistakes sometimes.</p>

            <li>Be consistent and keep your word<p>Children are smart,
                and they have good memories! They will learn very easily if you are not consistent and do not keep your
                word, and they will learn what they can get away with. You must follow through with it.<br><br>

                Yes, sometimes it feels as though you are punishing yourself, but it is crucial for them to know your
                word
                means something. When your child realizes you are full of empty threats, then it will be hard for them
                to
                listen to you in the future.</p>

            <li> Take Care Of Yourself As a Parent<p>It's all about
                balance. You've got to look after your own needs too, so make sure you're getting some support, time
                with
                friends, and maybe even a little time to yourself.</p>

        <h2>What Is Positive Parenting? Mutual Respect</h2>

        <p>Positive parenting is all about having a relationship with your child that is based on mutual respect. If
          you treat your child with respect in terms of hearing them, validating them, communicating with them, inviting
          them to question, challenge, and think for themselves, then they too will respect you.<br><br>

          If we show our children how to effectively build and strengthen relationships based on the ones we have with
          them, then they too will learn these invaluable skills.</p>
