          <p>For all the skills we have learnt, programming had always been
            there and it never felt exhausting from day one, when we first introduced programming in the family.
            It became one of our greatest passions in which it enabled us to build our own personal projects,
            digitise some of our own ideas and make things that are useful to other people.<br><br>

            We love creating solutions to problems and the most satisfying aspects of seeing
            code we wrote, deployed in a live system that are used by actual people, especially if it improves
            their lives in some way. Check out some of our completed projects that we have tirelessly worked on to keep
            us inspired and stay motivated.
