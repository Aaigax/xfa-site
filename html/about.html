              <h3>Alti aka (Thanos)</h3>
              <p>Becoming a father was wonderful and our
                children are a precious gift from God. Taking pictures of our family moments or doing what we love to do
                brings me joy. When I'm not working we will always be out exploring together or visiting our families
                and
                friends. A techie at heart with years of experience in finance and computer programming. I occasionally
                taught piano, record and performed music for special events for over 15 years.</p>

              <h3>Faye aka (Scarlet Witch)</h3>
              <p>Faye aka (Scarlet Witch) My surroundings and
                priorities is God to be the forefront and central in everything I do in life. I had the pleasure of
                working and being a fulltime mother to our 3 amazing boys. It's challenging but I love it and wouldn’t
                change it for anything. I love exploring nature, spending quality time with my family, cooking and
                reading because everyday is a gift from God.</p>

              <h3>Sonix aka (Venom)</h3>
              <p>I love being the oldest child in my
                family. I may always be expected to be the responsible one but my younger brothers sort of look up to
                me,
                which is pretty awesome. I love number crunching, computer science and playing music. I enjoy spending
                time with my family exploring new places. Tasmania was an amazing and unique experience as we walked
                through
                many waterfalls.</p>

              <h3>Lenix aka (Thor)</h3>
              <p>Being a middle child I'm often stuck in
                the middle but I tend to be great negotiators and compromisers than my brothers (haha). I'm always
                obsessed with robots and interacting with lego. On most obvious photos of me is that I love the colour
                green but I don't like tomato sauce. I can play many instruments such as piano, recorder, ukulele, and
                singing just to annoy my brothers.</p>

              <h3>Jerix aka (Venom)</h3>
              <p>Being the youngest child I get to respect
                my older brothers, especially when I can outrun them in a 100m race (haha). I'm highly energetic and an
                outgoing individual. My family calls me a jokemaker because I tell better jokes than my dad. I love
                travelling with my family exploring new places but I don't like spiders. Sometimes I do the baby voice
                just to annoy my brothers.</p>
