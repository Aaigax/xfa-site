              During every school holidays or special celebrations, we will always find something to

            <p>Road tripping from Melbourne to Sydney for Lenix 10th birthday and explored
              into some of Sydney's iconic places was an absolutely fantastic experience. You gotta love Scenic World
              and the amazing blue mountains views.<br><br>

              Unlimited rides on scenic railway down the mountain and the skywalk cable car with a glass bottom going
              across a very deep gorge with a stunning view of the waterfalls. Then we made a final stop walking along
              the Sea Cliff Bridge and seeing the beautiful crystal blue water from the top view. Ocean on one side and
              hills on another. Perfect spot to watch the sunrise over the ocean or explore under the bridge.

            <p>We took a trip to Tassie for Sonix's 10th birthday and visited some great

              places and parks.<br><br>

              To be honest, it's one of the most unique life experiences we encountered and that was
              such a pleasant surprise for us. We didn't do too much research before arriving so we're so thrilled to
              find some helpful people in the area - at one point we thought we were the only survivors. LOL!

            <p>New Zealand gave us the reason to order our kids first ever passports to
              travel to another country. We took a 10 day trip for Jerix's 5th birthday and visited some amazing places,
              and met some lovely people.<br><br>

              We had a wonderful time together and saw the region's amazing beauty.
              Our kids especially were so pleasantly surprised with how cool of a city it was. One of our highlights was
              when I asked our kids how would they describe New Zealand with one word? - "RUGBY" Loved it!

            <p>We were so excited to visit Gold Coast for the first time when we
              had heard such wonderful things about it especially the beaches
              and the theme parks. With all the hype surrounding it, we ended up
              going there twice for Sonix and Lenix's 5th birthdays.<br><br>

              We had an amazing time by visiting different places and trying out new
              things. Queensland was one of our first interstate trip on the plane together as a family and that
              definitely made our visit worth it with so much memories.
