          <h1>Education</h1>
          <p>Our home is filled with the love of learning
            and to incorporate the importance of learning in our everyday lives by trying out new things. We love to
            share some of our fun learning such as conducting science experiments, researching into STEM and
            participating in family educational activities.</p>

              <h1>Science</h1>
              <h3>Learn - is probably a better word choice for things that
                we don't yet know, and wondered how all of these things work?</h3>

              <p>Many of these fun science experiments we tried out ourselves gives us some meaning of
                knowledge to understand how things work and influence the way we think and feel.<br><br>

                Experimenting with different materials and reacting to it unexpected outcomes makes it more fun and
                engaging. Sometimes we failed to execute it but we kept trying. “That is Science.”<br><br>

                Make some cool projects then show friends & family what you’ve discovered and most importantly, have
                fun!

              <h1>Technology</h1>
              <h3>We code daily and coding allows us to understand the basic concept of - how to
                think rather than what to think.</h3>

              <p>At a very young age, we were practically surrounded with technology. At first we
                thought coding was too
                difficult to learn but in reality, it can be done by anyone at anytime.<br><br>

                Practise makes perfect and never stop learning.” Another thing we learned is that you learn more when
                you code something you like. A way to understand parts of code you never understood before.<br><br>

                Enjoy coding, show friends & family what you’ve created and most importantly, have fun!
